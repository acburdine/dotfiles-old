# dotfiles

Dotfiles that I use personally. 

*Note: These are used on a Macbook Pro, so they would take some modification in order to make them work for Linux distros*

## .bash_profile - Bash Customizations

My bash setup contains several aliases and other various environment variables used to make my development processes easier.

Requirements:
- [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com) - needs to have the cli shortcut installed as well. I use this for quick file editing.
- [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - Used to manage Node versions
- [RVM](https://github.com/rvm/rvm) - Used to manage Ruby versions.
- Bash Completion (used for git completions)
